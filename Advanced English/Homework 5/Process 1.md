The diagram illustrates the process of desalination, which involves removing salt from seawater to make it suitable for drinking. 

The first stage in the process is pre-treatment, which involves removing any debris or large particles from the seawater using a filtration system. The water is then passed through a reverse osmosis membrane, which separates the salt and other impurities from the water molecules. The resulting clean water is then stored in a tank ready for consumption.

One notable feature of this process is that it requires a significant amount of energy to operate, as the reverse osmosis membrane requires high pressure to separate the salt from the water. Another interesting point is that while desalination can provide access to clean drinking water in areas where freshwater resources are scarce, it is still an expensive and energy-intensive process compared to traditional methods of water treatment.

Overall, the diagram highlights the complex and resource-intensive nature of desalination as a means of providing clean drinking water.
