The diagram illustrates the process of producing sugar from sugar cane. There are seven steps involved, starting with the harvesting of sugar cane and ending with the packaging of refined sugar.

Firstly, the harvested sugar cane is transported to the mill where it is cut into small pieces and crushed to extract juice. Secondly, impurities are removed from the juice through a process called clarification. Thirdly, the juice is boiled until it thickens and becomes syrupy. The fourth step involves pouring the syrup into centrifugals where it is spun to separate solid crystals from liquid molasses.

Fifthly, the sugar crystals are washed and dried before being transferred to a refinery for further purification. Sixthly, refined sugar is produced by removing any remaining impurities using chemicals and heat. Finally, the refined sugar is packaged in bags or boxes and ready for distribution.

Overall, the production process involves several stages of purification and refinement to ensure high-quality granulated sugar.
