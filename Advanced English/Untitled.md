The diagram illustrates the process of desalination, which is the removal of salt from seawater to make it safe for consumption. The process involves four main stages: intake, pre-treatment, reverse osmosis, and post-treatment.

At the intake stage, seawater is extracted from the ocean and transported to the desalination plant. The pre-treatment stage involves removing large particles and debris such as sand and shells from the seawater through filtration. 

The third stage, reverse osmosis, uses a semi-permeable membrane to separate salt and other minerals from the water. This is done by applying pressure to the seawater as it passes through the membrane, causing it to leave behind salt ions and other impurities.

Finally, in the post-treatment stage, additional treatment processes are employed to ensure that any remaining impurities are removed before distributing the purified water for consumption.

Overall, this process highlights how technological advancements have made it possible to transform unusable seawater into drinkable water through sophisticated engineering techniques. It also underscores the importance of this technology in regions where access to clean drinking water is limited or non-existent.
