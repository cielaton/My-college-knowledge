**a.**
The first for loop takes `n+1`
The second for loop takes `n*(n+1)`
The third line cost `1`
$$Total\;cost = n * (n + 1) + n + 1 + 1 = n ^{2}+ 2n + 2$$
â†’ Complexity: $O(n^2)$ 
**b.**
The first and second for loop takes:
$\Large{\frac{(n + 1)*n}{2}}$ if n is odd
$\Large{\frac{(n+1)*n*}{2} + \frac{n+1}{2}}$ if n is even
