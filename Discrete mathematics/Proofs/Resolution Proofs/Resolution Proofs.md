**Resolution** is a proof technique that depends on a single rule:
$$\mathrm{If \;} p\vee q \mathrm{\; and \;} \neg p \vee r \mathrm{\; are \; both \; true}, \mathrm{\; then \;} q \vee r \mathrm{\; is \; true} $$

In a proof by resolution, the hypotheses and the conclusion are written as **clauses**. A clause consists of terms separated by *or's* where each term is a variable or the negation of a variable
