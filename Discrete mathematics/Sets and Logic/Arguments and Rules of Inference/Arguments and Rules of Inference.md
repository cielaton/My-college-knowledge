The process of drawing a conclusion from a sequence of propositions is called **deductive reasoning**.
The given propositions are called **hypotheses** or **premises**, and the proposition that follows from the hypotheses, is called the **conclusion**.
A (**deductive**) **argument** consists of hypotheses together with a conclusion.

Any argument has the form
<center>If <em>p1</em> and <em>p2</em> and ... and <em>pn</em>, then <em>q</em>.</center>
The above argument is said to be **valid** if the conclusion follows from the hypotheses.

--- 

An *argument* is a sequence of propositions written
$$p_1 $$
$$p_2$$
$$\vdots$$
$$p_n$$
$$\frac{}{\therefore q}$$
or 
$$p_1, p_2, ..., p_n/ \therefore q$$

The symbol $\therefore$ is read "therefore". The propositions $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$ are called the *hypotheses* (or *premises*), and the proposition *q* is called the *conclusion*. 
The argument is *valid* provided that if $p_1$ and $p_2$ and ... and $p_n$ are all true, then *q* must also be true. Otherwise, the argument is *invalid* (or *fallacy*).

**Rules of interference**, brief, valid argument, are used within a larger argument.
