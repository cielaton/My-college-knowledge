If *p* and *q* are proposition, the proposition
<center>if <em>p</em> then <em>q</em></center>
is called a *conditional proposition* and is denoted
$$p\rightarrow q$$ The proposition *p* is called the *hypothesis* (or *antecedent*), and the proposition *q* is called the *conclusion* (or *consequent*).

The truth table of the conditions proposition $p\rightarrow q$ is defined by:
| p   | q   | $p\rightarrow q$ |
| --- | --- |:----------------:|
| T   | T   |        T         |
| T   | F   |        F         |
| F   | T   |        T         |
| F   | F   |        T         |

If *p* and *q* are proposition, the proposition 
<center><em>p</em> if and only if <em>q</em></center>
is called a *biconditional proposition* and is denoted by
$$p\leftrightarrow q$$ The truth tabe of the propostition $p\leftrightarrow q$ is defined by:
| p   | q   | $p \leftrightarrow q$ |
| --- | --- |:---------------------:|
| T   | T   |           T           |
| T   | F   |           F           |
| F   | T   |           F           |
| F   | F   |           T           |

Suppose that the propositions P and Q are made up of the propositions $p_1, ..., p_n$. We say that P and Q are *logically equivalent* and write
$$P \equiv Q$$ provided that, given any truth values of $p_1, ..., p_2$, either P and Q are both true, or P and Q are both false.

The *contrapositive* (or *transposition*) of the conditional proposition $p\rightarrow q$ is the proposition $\neg q \rightarrow \neg p$.

Notice the difference between the contrapositive and the converse. The converse of a conditional proposition merely reverses the roles of *p* and *q* *and* negates each of them.
