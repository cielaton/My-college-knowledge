First, we do a dc analysis to find the Q-point, and then we perform an ac analysis to determine the behavior of the circuit as an amplifier.

The Q-point values must be found first because they determine the ac characteristics of the amplifier

**DC analysis**:
1. Find the DC equivalent circuit by replacing all capacitors with open circuits and inductors by short circuits.
2. Find the Q-point from the DC equivalent circuit using the appropriate large-signal model for the transistor.

**AC analysis**:
1. Find the AC equivalent circuit by replacing all capacitors by short circuits and all inductors by open circuits. DC voltage sources are replaced by short circuits, and DC current sources are replaced by open circuits in the ac equivalent circuit.
2. Replace the transistor by its small-signal model (Q-point dependent)
3. Analyze the AC characteristics of the amplifier using the small-signal AC equivalent circuit from step 2.
4. Combine with the results from DC analysis  to yield the total voltages and currents in the network.
