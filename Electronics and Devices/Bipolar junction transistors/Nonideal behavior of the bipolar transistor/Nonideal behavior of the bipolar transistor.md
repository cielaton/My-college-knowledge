- The emitter-base and collector-base diodes that form the bipolar transistor have finite reverse breakdown voltages that we must carefully consider when choosing a transistor or power supplies.
- There are also capacitance associated with each diode, and these capacitance place limitations on the high frequency response of the transistor.
- Holes and electron in semiconductor materials have finite velocities. Thus, it takes time for the carriers to move from the emitter to the collector, this time delay places an additional limit on the upper frequency of operation of the bipolar transistor.
