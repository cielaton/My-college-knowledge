The goal of biasing is to establish a known **quiescent operating point**, or **Q-point** that represents the initial operating region of the transistor. 
In the BJT, the Q-point is represented by the dc values of the *collector-current* and *collector-emitter* voltage:
- ($I_C, V_{CE}$) for the *npn* transistor
- ($I_C, V_{EC}$) for the *pnp* transistor

The Q-point controls values of diffusion capacitance, transconductance,
input and output resistances.
