<center><em>BJT transfer characteristic in the foward-active region</em></center>

![[Pasted image 20230330193037.png]]

The **common-emitter transfer characteristic** of the BJT defines the relationship between the collector current and the base-emitter voltage of the transistor.

> The transfer characteristic is virtually identical to that of a *pn* junction diode.

Only a 60-mV change in $v_{BE}$ is required to change the collector current by a factor of 10.
