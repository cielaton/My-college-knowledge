There are four possible regions of operation.

- When the transistor is in **cut off** region, we can consider it as an **open switch**.
- When the transistor is operating in the **saturation region**, we can treat it as a closed switch.

>[!note]
>**cut off** and **saturation** are most often used to represent the two states in binary logic circuits implemented with BJTs.

- In the **forward-active** region, the BJT can pride high current, voltage, and power gains.
>[!note]
>The forward-active region is most often used to achieve high-quality amplification.

- In the **reverse-active** region, the transistor exhibits low current gain, and this region is not often used.
