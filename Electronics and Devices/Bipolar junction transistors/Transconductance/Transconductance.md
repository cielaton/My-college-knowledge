$g_m$: **transconductance** (introduced in Chapter 4)
For the bipolar transistor, $g_m$ related changes in $i_C$ to changes in $v_{BE}$ and is defined by

>[!note]
>$$g_m = \frac{di_C}{dv_{BE}}\Big|_{Q-point}$$

For forward-active region

>[!note]
>$$g_m = \frac{1}{V_T}I_S \; exp \left(\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\right) = \frac{I_C}{V_T}$$

The expression for the transit time can be rewritten as:

>[!note]
>$$\tau_F = \frac{C_D}{g_m} \hspace{20pt} or \hspace{20pt} C_D = g_m\tau_F$$
