**Binary** logic gates are the most common style of digital logic.

The output will consist of either *0 (low)* or *1 (high)*

The positive and negative power supplies, shown explicitly as $V_+$ and $V_-$ are not included in most logic diagrams.
- For input voltages $v_i$ below the *reference voltage $V_{REF}$*, the output $v_o$ will be in the **high logic level at the gate output $V_H$**.
- For  $v_i$ increases and exceeds $V_{REF}$, the output voltage changes abruptly to the **low logic level at the gate output $V_L$**.

>[!note]
>$V_+ = 5V$ and $V_- = 0$ represented the standard power supply for logic for many years
