The **noise margin in the high state $NM_H$** and the **noise margin in the low state $NM_L$** represent "safety margins" that prevent the gate from producing erroneous logic decisions in the presence of noise sources

The noise margin associated with a low input level is defined by
$$NM_L = V_{IL} - V_{OL}$$

The noise margin associated with a high input level is defined by
$$NM_H = V_{OH} - V_{IH}$$
