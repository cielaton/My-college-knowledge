The input current is determined by the **source resistance $R_I$** and the **input resistance** $R_{in}$ of the amplifier.

The **current gain** is defined as the ratio of the phasor representations of $i_o$ and $i_i$:
$$A_i = \frac{i_o}{i_i} = \frac{I_o\angle\theta}{I_i\angle 0} = \frac{I_o}{I_i}\angle \theta$$
$$|A_i| = \frac{I_o}{I_i}$$
