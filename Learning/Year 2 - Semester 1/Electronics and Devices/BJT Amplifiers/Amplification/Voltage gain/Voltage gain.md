The **voltage gain $A_v$** of an amplifier is defined in terms of the **phasor representations** of the input and output voltages. 

The phasor representation of
- $v_i$ is $v_i = V_i \angle 0^\circ$ and that for $v_o = V_o \angle \theta$.
- $i_i = I_i\angle 0^\circ$ and $i_o = I_o \angle \theta$

The voltage gain is then expressed by the phasor ratio:
$$A_v = \frac{v_o}{v_i} = \frac{V_o\angle \theta}{V_i\angle 0} = \frac{V_o}{V_i}\angle \theta$$
Or 
$$|A_v| = \frac{V_o}{V_i} \hspace{20pt} and \hspace{20pt} \angle A_v = \theta$$
