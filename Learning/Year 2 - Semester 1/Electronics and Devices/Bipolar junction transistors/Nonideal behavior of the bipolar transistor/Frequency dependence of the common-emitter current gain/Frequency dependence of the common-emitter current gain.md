The forward-biased diffusion and reverse-biased *pn* junction capacitance of the bipolar transistor cause the current gain of the transistor to be frequency-dependent.

At low frequencies, the current gain has a constant value $\beta_F$, but as frequency increases, the current gain begins to decrease.

The **unity-gain frequency** $f_T$ is defined to be the frequency at which the magnitude of the current gain is equal to 1. The behavior of the graph is described by

$$\beta(f) = \frac{\beta_F}{\sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{f}{f_\beta}\right)^2}}$$

Where $f_\beta = f_R / \beta_F$ is the **$\beta$ cutoff frequency**
