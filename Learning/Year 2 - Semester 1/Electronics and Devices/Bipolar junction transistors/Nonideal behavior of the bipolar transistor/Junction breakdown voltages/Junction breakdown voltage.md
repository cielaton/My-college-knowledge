The bipolar transistor is formed from two back-to-back diodes, each of them has a Zener breakdown voltage associated with it -> If the reverse voltage across either *pn* junction is too large, the corresponding diode will breakdown.

The emitter region is the most heavily doped region and the collector is the most lightly doped region, this leads to:
- Low breakdown voltage for the base-emitter diode.
- High breakdown voltage for the collector-base diode.
