- $V_L$: The nominal voltage corresponding to a low-logic state at the output of a logic gate for $v_I = V_H$. Generally, $V_- \leq V_L$
- $V_H$: The nominal voltage corresponding to a high-logic state at the output of a logic gate for $v_I = V_L$. Generally, $V_H \leq V_+$
- $V_{IL}$: The maximum input voltage that will be recognized as a low input logic level
- $V_{OH}$: The output voltage corresponding to an input voltage of $V_{IL}$
- $V_{OL}$: The output voltage corresponding to an input voltage of $V_{IH}$
