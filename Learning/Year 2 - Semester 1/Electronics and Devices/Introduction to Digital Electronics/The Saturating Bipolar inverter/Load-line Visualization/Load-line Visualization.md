The BJT only switches between the two operating points on the load line.

- At the right-hand end of the load line, the BJT is *cut off*, with $i_C = 0$ and $v_{CE} = 5V$.
- At the Q-point near the left end of the load line, the BJT represents a low resistance in the *saturation region*, with $v_o = V{CESAT}$
