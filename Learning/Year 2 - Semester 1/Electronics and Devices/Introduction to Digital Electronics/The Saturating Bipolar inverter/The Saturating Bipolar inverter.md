The circuit uses a single BJT switching device $Q_2$ to pull $v_o$ down to $V_L$ and a resistor load element to pull the output up to the power supply $V_{CC}$

The input voltage $v_I$ and the base current $i_B$ supplied to the base of the bipolar transistor will be designed to switch $Q_2$ between the **saturation** and **nonconducting** states.

>When a transistor saturates, its base-emitter voltage increases slightly, and $V_{BE} = V_{BESAT}$.
