The requirement for a center-tapped transformer in the full-wave rectifier can be eliminated through the use of two additional diodes.

For $v_I>0$, $D_2$ and $D_4$ will be on and $D_1$ and $D_3$ will be off. The dc output voltage:
$$V_{dc}=V_P - 2V_{on}$$

For $v_I<0$, $D_1$ and $D_3$ will be on and $D_2$ and $D_4$ will be off.

A negative output voltage can be generated by reversing the direction of the diodes:
