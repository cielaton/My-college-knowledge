Consider the statement
<center><strong>The sum of any two positive real numbers is positive</strong></center>

We first note that since two numbers are involved, we will need two variables, say $x$ and $y$. The assertion can be restated as:
$$\mathrm{If \;} x>0 \mathrm{\; and \;} y > 0, \mathrm{\; then \;} x + y >0$$
If we let $P(x, y)$ denote the expression $(x >0) \wedge (y > 0) \rightarrow (x + y > 0)$, the given statement can be written symbolically as
$$\forall x\forall yP(x,y)$$

The domain of discourse of the two-variable propositional function $P$ is $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$, which means that each variable $x$ and $y$ must belong to the set of real numbers.

Multiple quantifiers such as $\forall x \forall y$ are said to be **nested quantifiers**.
