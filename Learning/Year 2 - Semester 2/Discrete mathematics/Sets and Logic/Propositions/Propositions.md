A sentence that is either true or false, *but not both*, is called a **proposition**.

Let *p* and *q* be propositions
- The *conjunction* of *p* and *q*, denoted $p \wedge q$, is the proposition *p* **and** *q*.
- The *disjunction* of *p* and *q*, denoted $p \vee q$, is the proposition *p*  **or** *q*.

---

The truth values of propositions such as conjunctions and disjunctions can be described by **truth tables**.

Ex: 

| p   | q   | p ^ q |
| --- | --- |:-----:|
| T   | T   |   T   |
| T   | F   |   F   |
| F   | T   |   F   |
| F   | F   |   F   |

The final operator on a proposition *p* is the **negation** of *p*.
The *negation* of *p*, denoted $\neg p$, is the proposition **not** *p*.
