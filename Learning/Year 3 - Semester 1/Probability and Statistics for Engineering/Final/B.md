#### I.
A public bus company official claims that mean waiting time for bus number 14 during peak hours is less than 10 minutes and the waiting time is a normal distribution. A college student took bus number 14 during peak hours on 18 different occasions. Her mean waiting time was 7.4 minutes, with a standard deviation of 1.7 minutes. At the 0.01 level of significance, test the claim that the mean is less than 10 minutes.
Given $t_{-0.01,17} = -2.567$.

#### II.
An electrical firm manufactures light bulbs that have a length of life that, is approximately normally distributed with a standard deviation of 40 hours. If a sample of 30 bulbs has an average life of 780 hours, find a 96% confidence interval for the population mean of all bulbs produced by this firm. How large a sample is needed if we wish to be 96% confident that our sample mean will be within 10 hours of the true mean?
Given $z_{0.02} = 2.054$; $z_{0.04} = 1.75$.

#### III.
An electrical firm manufactures light bulbs that have a length of life that is approximately normally distributed, with a mean equal to 800 hours and a standard deviation of 40 hours. Find the probability that a random sample of 16 bulbs will have an average life of less than 775 hours.
Given $z_{0.0668} = 1.5$; $z_{0.0062} = 2.5$; $z_{0.002} = 3.5$
