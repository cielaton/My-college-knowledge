Constructing a histogram for continuous data (measurements) entails subdividing the measurement axis into a suitable number of **class intervals** or **classes**, such that each observation is contained in exactly one class.

>[!note] Constructing a Histogram for Continuous Data: Equal class width
>1. Determine the frequency and relative frequency for each class.
>2. Mark the class boundaries on a horizontal measurement axis.
>3. Above each class interval, draw a rectangle whose height is the corresponding relative frequency (or frequency).

>[!note]
>Generally, the larger the number of observations in a data set, the more classes should be used. A reasonable rule of thumb is:
>$$\mathrm{number \; of \; classes = \sqrt{number\;of\;observation}}$$

>[!note] Constructing a Histogram for Continuous Data: Unequal Class Widths
>After determine frequencies and relative frequencies, calculate the height of each rectangle using the formula:
>$$\mathrm{rectangle\;height = \frac{relative\;frequency}{class\;width}}$$
>The result usually called *density*.
