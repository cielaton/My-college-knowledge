The line graph illustrates the number of stores opening and closing in a country over a period of 7 years starting from 2011. As can be seen from the graph, there is a similar fluctuation in the pattern of closed and opened shops over the years. From 2011 to 2012, the quantity of opened places dropped dramatically from 8500 to 4000, a decrease nine times larger than the number of stores closing that year. Over the next two years, the number of new stores increased significantly to 6000 but then dipped down to 4000 in only one year and remained the same until 2016. The closures followed a different path, gradually reaching 7200 in 2013 and then crashing to under 1000 places in 2015. The breakpoint was the lowest, and it rocketed up to about 5200 in 2016. From this point, the quantity remained approximately stable for both objects.
