#### I.
Traveling between two campuses of a university in a city via shuttle bus takes, on average, 28 minutes with a standard deviation of 5 minutes. In a given week, a bus transported passengers 40 times. What is the probability that the average transport time was more than 30 minutes?  Assume the mean time is measured to the nearest minute.
Given $z_{0.00078} = 3.16$; $z_{0.025} = 1.96$; $z_{0.015} = 2.16$; $z_{0.0052} = 2.56$

##### II.
The average zinc concentration recovered from a sample of measurements taken in 36 different locations in a river is found to be 2.6 grams per milliliter. Find the 95% and 99% confidence intervals for the mean zinc concentration in the river. Assume that the population has normal distribution and standard deviation is 0.3 gram per milliter.
