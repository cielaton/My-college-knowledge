Consider data consisting of observations on a discrete variable *x*. 
The frequency of any particular x value is the number of times that value occurs in the data set.
The **relative frequency** of a value is the fraction or proposition of times the value occurs:
$$\mathrm{Relative\;frequency}=\frac{\mathrm{number\; of \; times\; the\; value \; occurs}}{\mathrm{number\; of \;observations}}$$

>[!note] Constructing a Histogram for Discrete Data
>1. Determine the frequency and relative frequency for each x value.
>2. Mark possible x values on a horizontal scale.
>3. Above each value, draw a rectangle whose height is the relative frequency (or frequency) of that value.
