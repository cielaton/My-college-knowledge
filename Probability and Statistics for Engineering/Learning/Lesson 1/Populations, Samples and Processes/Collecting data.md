Statistics deals not only with the organization and analysis of data once it has been collected, but also with the development of *techniques for collecting data*

If the data is not properly collected, an investigator may not be able to answer the questions under consideration with a reasonable degree of confidence.

One common problem is that the target population may be different from the population actually sampled.
