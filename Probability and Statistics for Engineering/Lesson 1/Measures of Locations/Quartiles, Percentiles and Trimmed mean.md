The median divides the data set into two parts of equal sign.
**Quartiles** divide the data set into **four equal parts**:
- The first quartile separating the *lower quarter*.
- The second quartile being identical to the median.
- The third quartile, constituting the *upper quarter* of the data set.

Similarly, a data set can be even more finely divided using **percentiles**.

A Trimmed mean is a compromised between mean and median. A 10% trimmed mean, for example, would be computed by eliminating the smallest 10% and the largest 10% of the sample and then averaging what is left over.
