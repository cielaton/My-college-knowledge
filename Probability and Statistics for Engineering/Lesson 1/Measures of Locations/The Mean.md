>The sample mean $\overline{x}$ of observations $x_1,x_{2,}... x_n$ is given by:
>$$\large{\overline{x} = \frac{x_1+ x_2+ ... + x_n}{n} = \frac{\Sigma_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}}$$

The average of all values in the population is called the population mean and **denoted by** $\micro$
On statistics inference, we will present methods based on the sample mean for drawing conclusions about a population mean.
**Mean** can be greatly affected by the presence of even a single outlier (unusually **large or small** observation).
