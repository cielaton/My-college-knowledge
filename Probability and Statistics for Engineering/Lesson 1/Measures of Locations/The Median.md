The sample median is the middle value once the observations are ordered from smallest to largest.

>[!note]
>The sample median, denoted by $\tilde{x}$, is obtained by first ordering the *n* observations from smallest to largest. Then $\tilde{x}$ is:
>- The single middle value if *n* is odd.
>- The average of the two middle values if *n* is even.

The sample median is **not** sensitive to outliers.
The middle value in the population, denoted by $\tilde{\micro}$

>Both quantities **mean** and **median** describe where the data is centered, but they will not in general be equal.
>The population mean and median will not be generally identical.
