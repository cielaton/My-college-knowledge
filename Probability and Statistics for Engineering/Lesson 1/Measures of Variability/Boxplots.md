*Stem-and-leaf*, *Dotplot* displays and *histograms* convey rather general impressions about a data set.
*Mean*, *median* or standard deviation focuses on just single aspects of the data 

A pictorial summary called a **Boxplot** has been used successfully to describe several of a data setâ€™s most prominent features.

##### What does a Boxplot tell you?
- Center 
- Spread
- The extent and nature of any departure from symmetry
- Identification of Outliers, observation that usually lie far from the main body of the data
>[!note]
>Order the *n* observations from smallest to largest and separate the smallest half from the largest half; the median $\tilde{x}$ is included in both halves if *n* is odd.
>The **lower fourth** is the median of the smallest half and the **upper fourth** is the median of the largest half.
>A measure of spread that is resistant to outliers is the **fourth spread** $f_s$, given by:
>$$\large{f_{s}= upper \; fourth - lower \; fourth}$$
