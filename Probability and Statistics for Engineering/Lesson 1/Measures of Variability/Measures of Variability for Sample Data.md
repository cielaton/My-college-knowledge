The simplest measure of variability in a sample is the **range**, which is the difference between the largest and smallest sample values.
The measures of variability involve the **deviations from the mean**, which can be obtained by subtracting $\tilde{x}$ from each of the $n$ observations.

>[!note]
>The **sample variance**, denoted by $s^2$ is given by 
>$$\large{s^{2} = \frac{\Sigma{(x_{i}- \tilde{x}) ^ {2}}{n - 1}}= = \frac{S_{xx}}{n-1}}$$
>The **sample standard deviation**, denoted by $s$, is the *positive* square root of the variance:
>$$s = \sqrt{s^2}$$
