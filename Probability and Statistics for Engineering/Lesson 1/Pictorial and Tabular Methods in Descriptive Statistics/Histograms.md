>A numerical variable is **discrete** if its sets of *possible* values either is finite or else can be listed in an infinite sequence.
>A numerical variable is **continuous** if its *possible* values consist of an entire interval on the number line.

#### Discrete variable:
Consider data consisting of observations on a discrete variable *x*. 
The frequency of any particular x value is the number of times that value occurs in the data set.
The **relative frequency** of a value is the fraction or proposition of times the value occurs:
$$\mathrm{Relative\;frequency}=\frac{\mathrm{number\; of \; times\; the\; value \; occurs}}{\mathrm{number\; of \;observations}}$$

>[!note] Constructing a Histogram for Discrete Data
>1. Determine the frequency and relative frequency for each x value.
>2. Mark possible x values on a horizontal scale.
>3. Above each value, draw a rectangle whose height is the relative frequency (or frequency) of that value.

#### Continuous variable:
Constructing a histogram for continuous data (measurements) entails subdividing the measurement axis into a suitable number of **class intervals** or **classes**, such that each observation is contained in exactly one class.

>1. Determine the frequency and relative frequency for each class.
>2. Mark the class boundaries on a horizontal measurement axis.
>3. Above each class interval, draw a rectangle whose height is the corresponding relative frequency (or frequency).
