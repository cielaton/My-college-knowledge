Write a recursive Boolean function named isMember. The function should accept two arguments: an array and a value. The function should return true if the value is found in the array, or false if the value is not found in the array

Write the solution for the above problem in Cpp using recursion and make sure there is no error.



Here's the solution in C++:

```cpp
bool isMember(int arr[], int size, int value) {
    if (size == 0) { // base case: array is empty
        return false;
    }
    if (arr[size - 1] == value) { // base case: value found
        return true;
    }
    return isMember(arr, size - 1, value); // recursive case: search the rest of the array
}
```

This function takes an integer array `arr`, its size `size`, and a target value `value` as arguments. The function first checks if the array is empty (`size == 0`), in which case it returns `false` because the target value cannot be found in an empty array. Then it checks if the last element of the array (`arr[size - 1]`) is equal to the target value, in which case it returns `true` because the target value has been found. If neither of these base cases applies, then the function makes a recursive call to itself with a smaller size argument (`size - 1`) and returns whatever that call returns. This effectively searches all elements of the array one by one until either the target value is found or all elements have been searched without finding it.

Note that this implementation assumes that the input array is sorted in ascending order. If this assumption does not hold, then additional logic may be needed to ensure correct behavior of the function.
