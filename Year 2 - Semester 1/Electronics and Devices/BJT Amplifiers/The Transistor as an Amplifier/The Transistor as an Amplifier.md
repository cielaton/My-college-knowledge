A BJT is use as an amplifier when biased in the forward-active region
We must provide bias to the transistor in order to stabilize the operating point in the active region of operation.

The **Q-point** controls many amplifier characteristics:
- Small-signal parameters of the transistor
- Voltage gain, input resistance, and output resistance
- Maximum input and output signal amplitudes
- Power consumption
