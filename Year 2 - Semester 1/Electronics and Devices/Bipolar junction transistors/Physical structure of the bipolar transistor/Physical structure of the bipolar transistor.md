The bipolar transistor structure consist of three alternating layers of **n-** and **p-** type semiconductor material. Referred to as:
- **emitter (E)**
- **base (B)**
- **collector (C)**:

During normal operation, a majority of the current enters the collector terminal, crosses the base region, and exits from the emitter terminal.
A small current also enters the base terminal, crosses the base-emitter junction of the transistor, and exits the emitter.
