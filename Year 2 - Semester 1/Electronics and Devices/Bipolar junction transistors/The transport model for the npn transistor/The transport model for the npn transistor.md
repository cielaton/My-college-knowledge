At first glance, the BJT appears to simply be two *pn* junctions connected back to back. The central region (base) is very thin, and the proximity of the two junctions leads to **coupling** between the two diodes.

The emitter injects electron into the base region of the device. Almost all the injected electrons travel across the narrow base region are removed (or collected) by the collector.

There are three terminal currents:
- Collector current $i_C$
- Emitter current $i_E$
- Base current $i_E$
And three junction voltage:
- Base-emitter voltage $v_{BE}$
- Base-collector voltage $v_{BC}$
- Collector-emitter voltage $v_{EC}$
  
$v_{BE}$ and $v_{BC}$ determine the magnitude of these three currents, and are defined as positive when they forward-bias their respective *pn* junctions.

The arrow part of the symbol **identifiers** the emitter terminal and indicates that dc current normally **exits the emitter** of the *npn* transistor.
