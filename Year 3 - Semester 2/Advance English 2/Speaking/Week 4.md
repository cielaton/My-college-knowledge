###### School days
>[!question] Tell me something about your secondary school.
> It's an enormous and long-standing school named Ly Thuong Kiet. Coming from the outside is a wide range yard with an extraordinary water fountain in the center, surrounded by three class buildings.

>[!question] Which subject did you find most difficult at school?
>I have always had trouble learning English in secondary or even high school. The reason for this is I did not pay enough attention in English class in primary school, and the knowledge gap in this subject has been created ever since.

>[!question] Do you ever need that subject now?
>Yes, of course, how can you live without English, especially in the technology era? I have realized the importance of this subject since I went to University. English is a necessary tool to obtain good documentation and information about every course I have taken.

>[!question] What did you enjoy about being a school student?
> Besides learning, creating some good memories with teachers and friends is an indispensable part of being a school student. I was lucky to take part in a school's camping festival in secondary school, hanging out with friends on the beach in the early morning or late at night when we had nothing to do. That's something I will never forget.

###### Buildings

>My hometown does not necessarily have any famous buildings, but it does have a few landmarks that are well-known in the area. One of them is the 29 March Park, a massive traditional park in the center of the city. 

>[!question] In what type of building do most people in your hometown live?
> The majority of people in my hometown live in a multi-story house and most of them looks the same. There are some apartments in my hometown as well, for people who prefer a fully equipped place with a reasonable price.

>[!question] Should buildings be attractive to look at?
>It's depend on the building purpose and the owner. For example, a personal home does not need to be attractive, but it could be decorated
