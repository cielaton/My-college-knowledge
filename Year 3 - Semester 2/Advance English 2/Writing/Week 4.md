The line graph illustrates the number of closed and opened stores in one country over a period of 7 years starting from 2011. As can be seen from the graph, there is a similar fluctuation in the changes of closed and opened shops over the years. From 2011 to 2012, the quantity of opened places decreased  dramatically from 8500 to 4000, about 9 times larger than the change in shuttled shop. The number of opened store then increased significantly to 6000 over the next two years, and return to 4000 in only one year and remain the same until 2016.
